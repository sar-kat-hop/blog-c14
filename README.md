# Tech Blog (Challenge 14)

## About

Note: This app is still a WIP and not functioning as intended.

This is a basic CMS-style blog/forum where visitors can view comments on the homepage. Users can register for an account, which will allow them to make, edit, and delete posts. The app will authenticate the user and makes use of express sessions.

## Installation

Please note that ss of 2/12, the deployments aren't working. Better results may be possible with local testing.
